Bootstrap Starter
=================

A basic responsive ready template.. Not yet production ready because, life.

##Getting Started

###The Wussy Way
1. Just Download the Master Zip, let the stronger folk keep things neat and tidy (this thing is really not prime-time ready though..)

###The Way Way
1. Visit https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/ for information on setting up Git.
2. Download the Git client (for [https://windows.github.com/](Mac) and for [https://windows.github.com/](Windows) )
3. You're going to get your hands dirty in the command line and install:
  1. Node.js ([http://nodejs.org/](nodejs.org/))
  2. NPM (which comes with Node.js, but visit [https://www.npmjs.org/](www.npmjs.org) for more information)
  3. Bower (installed using NPM, see [http://bower.io/](bower.io))
  4. Grunt (installed using NPM, see [http://gruntjs.com/getting-started](gruntjs.com))


##To-Do
- [ ] Fork the Dev branch of this repo (on my to-do list) for shared access and staging to Master
- [ ] Organize dependancies into production-ready directories using Grunt and whatever NPMs might be needed to automate
- [ ] Declare production-ready, ducks row in, t's crossed i's dotted
